## Why the name?

*Mending Wall* is a [poem written by Robert Frost](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mending_Wall), published in 1914. Two neighbors walk the line of a stone wall between their respective properties, making repairs. One theme is how walls both unite and divide us. The famous line, "Good fences make good neighbors," is spoken by one of the neighbors and reflects their life view, which contrasts with the beliefs of the other.

Where walls should and should not exist between desktop environments is unclear, and subject to user preference. Mending Wall, the app, expresses the view that the default walls need some repair.
