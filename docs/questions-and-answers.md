## Why the name?

*Mending Wall* is a [poem written by Robert Frost](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mending_Wall), published in 1914. One of its themes is how walls can both unite and divide us. Two neighbors walk the line of a stone wall between their respective properties, making repairs. The famous line, "Good fences make good neighbors," is spoken by one of them, reflecting a life view that is different from that of the other.

When it comes to desktop environments, it is unclear where walls should and should not exist, and user preference surely has a role. Mending Wall, the app, expresses the view that the current state needs some repair.
