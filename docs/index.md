# **Mending Wall**

**Linux distributions offer a choice of desktop environment, but installing more than one can break themes and clutter menus. Mending Wall fixes this, so you can enjoy them all.**

    Use GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, and Cinnamon on the same user account without broken themes and cluttered menus. Enjoy a change of scenery.

    You've chosen a Linux distribution, but which desktop environment? Mending Wall lets you try a few before you settle down, without breaking anything. It also lets you never settle down.

    Mending Wall fixes common issues when hopping between desktop environments, such as  tiny cursors :material-cursor-default:{style="font-size:10px;"}, huge cursors :material-cursor-default:{style="font-size:24px;"}, tiny fonts :material-format-font:{style="font-size:10px;"}, huge fonts :material-format-font:{style="font-size:24px;"}, unintended dark mode changes, icon changes, and scaling issues on HiDPI displays.

    ---
  
    Desktop environments each have their own core applications like a terminal, file manager, and text editor. With more than one desktop environment installed, menus can become cluttered with these. Mending Wall tidies menus to show core applications in their native desktop environment only. No more six terminals, five file managers, and three text editors.

    Start it up and switch it on. The best time is before you log in to a second desktop environment.

    In future, Mending Wall may allow recovery from a state that is already broken, such as after using multiple desktop environments without Mending Wall enabled.
