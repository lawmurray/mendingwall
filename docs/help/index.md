# How You Can Help

Mending Wall is designed to make contributions as easy as possible, either with or without programming experience. User contributions are essential to expand coverage of desktop environments and Linux distributions. You can help with:

- [Improving the *manage counterpart applications* feature](counterpart-applications.md), e.g. adding a missing application or a whole new desktop environment. This only requires editing config files.
- [Improving the *preserve themes* feature](preserve-themes.md), e.g. finding and fixing breakages or adding support for a whole new desktop environment. This only requires editing config files.
- [Reporting issues](https://github.com/lawmurray/mendingwall/issues), e.g. bugs in the app, problems with the above features on particular Linux distributions or in particular desktop environments, etc.
- Adding whole new features. This requires programming. Mending Wall is written in C as a GNOME application using Adwaita, GTK4, and [Blueprint](https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/).

All contributions can be made via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lawmurray/mendingwall), either via an [issue](https://github.com/lawmurray/mendingwall/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/lawmurray/mendingwall/pull_requests).

!!! tip
    If GitHub is unfamiliar to you, just start by opening an issue to describe the problem that you have found, the results of your investigation so far, and a proposed fix if you have one. Others can help from there.
