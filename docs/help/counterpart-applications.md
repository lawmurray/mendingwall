# How You Can Help: Counterpart Applications

This is a simpler task to investigating breakages. Most desktop environments have core applications such as a file manager, text editor, and calculator, perhaps dictionary or maps, that have counterparts in other desktop environments. Some desktop environments mark these only for display in that desktop environment, others desktop environments do not, which can clutter menus.

To declutter the menus, applications can be restricted to only appear in certain desktop environments via Mending Wall's `counterpart-applications.conf` configuration file.
