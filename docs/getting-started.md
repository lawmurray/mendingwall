After installation, start the Mending Wall app and switch on the *Tidy Menus* and/or *Mend Themes* toggles. Both are recommended. The best time to do this is before you log in to a second desktop environment.

!!! help "Theme already broken?"
    This may happen if you have used multiple desktop environments **before** starting Mending Wall. It is currently a **work in progress** to provide a feature to recover from this situation. You might consider [contributing your time](how-to-help.md) or [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/lawmurray) to help with this.
    
Mending Wall is currently being tested, and could do with [your help](how-you-can-help.md). Desktop environments are all configured differently, but Linux distributions may also configure the same desktop environment differently, and so it is important to test widely across the two dimensions. As a guide, the following represents the current status.
