# Getting Started

Packages for major Linux distributions are provided at [download.indii.org](https://download.indii.org). If a package is not available for your operating system you can [install from source](https://github.com/lawmurray/mendingwall).

To use Mending Wall, start the app and enable [Tidy Menus](tidy-menus.md) and/or [Untangle Themes](untangle-themes.md). For the recommended experience, enable both.
