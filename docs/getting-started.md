# Getting Started

Packages for major Linux distributions are provided at [download.indii.org](https://download.indii.org). If a package is not available for your operating system you can [install from source](https://github.com/lawmurray/mendingwall).

To use Mending Wall, start the app and enable [Manage Menus](manage-menus.md) and/or [Protect Themes](protect-themes.md). For the recommended experience, enable both.

!!! tip
    If you're here because your GNOME theme is already broken (e.g. you were using GNOME, decided to try KDE, and are having issues after logging back into GNOME), use *Restore Default GNOME Theme* for a quick fix, and enable *Protect Themes* to stop it happening again.
